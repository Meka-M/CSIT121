            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>The final project was nice to see in its completion. To see how I progressed over these ten labs, it made me want to continue to grasp HTML, CSS, JavaScript and grow my knowledge. I did have a hard time trying to link all of these pages to each other, too a long time, but I am glad I got it and it’s seamless. I also ran into some trouble about linking the screenshots of the labs to the labs themselves. I forgot I needed to actually upload my final project first to GitHub to get it to work right.</p>
            <p>I tested my final project on both Google Chrome and Microsoft edge. Everything looked and worked like I wanted it to. I also looked at the final project on my phone, and the scaling and such worked out fine for my portfolio, but it was tough trying to fix the scaling for some of my past labs. I know how important it is to check my sites on different devices and browsers to make sure it’s still accessible for everyone, so I will continue to do that in the future.</p>
            <p>Looking back, I learned a good bit about coding HTML and CSS, and I hope to dive into JavaScript more, Learning that the design and accessibility are just as important as the structure was also important. I know we touched on JavaScript, and I am not as comfortable with it, but this class has helped me get a basic understanding of it. I cannot wait to continue creating pages as a hobby moving forward.</p>
