        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>I enjoyed making a rate chart (always thought these were cool). Being able to focus on a tier list that I could reflect my childhood TV shows with made the lab even more enjoyable. I felt comfortable with creating the table after the activity. I was able to remove things and tweak things here and there. I got to learn how to add color to each single row, which was easy and made sense after the fact (I thought it was going to be hard). The form page was a bit trickier, but it was still a great thing to learn about and see my creation.</p>
