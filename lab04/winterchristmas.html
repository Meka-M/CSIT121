            <h2>Description</h2>
            <img src="images/winterchristmas400.gif" alt="Winterland Image">
            <p>This is a image of a winter wonderland with christmas objects like a reindeer, santa with a sleigh pulled by a horse, a kid building a snowman, and a pond.</p>
            <h3>File Type</h3>
            <p>This file type is a Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) file. I know this because the abbreviation after the period is gif.</p>
            <h4>Why I picked this image</h4>
            <p>I picked this image because I just love christmas and winter! I am pretty sure I am biased because I was born in January, but it's my favorite time of the year.</p>
