            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm from the South and I enjoy any and everything music related. Gaining my BA in technology wasn't my first passion, which looking
                back on, was crazy! I was a healthcare major at first, but I know I found the right path. I love to travel to historical places and 
                I hope to one day visit Washington D.C. again and sightsee in New York City.
