        <p>These past two weeks have been interesting to begin grasping the information around HTML. I can say that I am starting to understand slowly but surely. I do enjoy seeing the work I make in Visual Studio Code come to life on the web! I also learned how important it is to keep your files on your C drive. I am so used to using OneDrive, I tend to forget the importance of it.</p>

            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>How to use GitHub</li>
                <li>Structuring HTML code</li>
            </ol>   
            <p>I can say that all the tags I read about and some that I scanned through on websites, it is daunting, but I am glad that we have plenty of resources to use to aid us in the class. These websites were great resources:</p>
