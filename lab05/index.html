            <p><i>Published on September 11, 2024 (updated October 17, 2024) by Meka Mitchell</i></p> 
            <p>These past two weeks have been interesting to begin grasping the information around HTML. I can say that I am starting to understand slowly but surely. I do enjoy seeing the work I make in Visual Studio Code come to life on the web! I also learned how important it is to keep your files on your C drive. I am so used to using OneDrive, I tend to forget the importance of it.</p>

            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>How to use GitHub</li>
                <li>Structuring HTML code</li>
            </ol>   
            <p>I can say that all the tags I read about and some that I scanned through on websites, it is daunting, but I am glad that we have plenty of resources to use to aid us in the class. These websites were great resources:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp">W3Schools</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.tutorialstonight.com/html/html-introduction">Tutorials Tonight</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Now that we have dived into CSS, I can say things are getting intense. This week has been cool to see CSS and HTML working together. Of course I know things are not going to be easy as we continue, but since last week, I think I am understanding as we continue. I really have to focus in on CSS, it is very in-depth, HTML was a little bit more straight forward. Excited to continue!</p>

            <h4 id="lab03" class="blog">Reflection for Lab 3</h4>
            <p id="reflection">This module was a doozy. I think this was a good start to CSS, even though I know it is complicated to grasp at first. The units of measure and selectors will fun to work with and liven up my pages. All in all, this week has been difficult, but I do hope I am on the right path to success! </p>

            <h4 id="lab05" class="blog">Reflection for Lab 5</h4>
            <p>When it comes to designing web pages, there are many design practices that are important to follow. HTML is the bones of a website, but the layout is just as important. Accessibility and responsiveness are two important things that a website has to have. This week we learned about flexbox and grid layout. These are responsive layouts and makes the website more appealing to look at. You can also use media queries to the site, which can change the sites screen from desktop screen sized to phone screen sized or tablet screen sized.</p>
